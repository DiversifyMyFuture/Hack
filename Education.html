                            Make sure to also pay attention to religions exemptions to Title IX that are granted to some schools. Title IX is a civil rights law that prevents discrimination on the basis of sex.
</br>- <b>Bathroom Policies</b> Housing and restroom policies can go a long way toward making a college campus feel welcoming to LGBT students.

</br>- <b>Housing Policies</b> Open housing allows students to live with a roommate of their choice regardless of gender identity. For transgender and nonbinary students, this makes housing less complicated.
</br>- <b>Available Resources</b> Experts say that most colleges will have LGBT student organizations, but that's only a starting point.
